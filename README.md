This page comprises of the material used for tutoring an introductory course in Bayesian Econometrics. The documents discuss theory, present True or False Questions, and contain exercises to practice the principles of Bayesian analysis. In particular, the following subjects are touched upon:
- Frequentist vs. Bayesian approach;
- Prior, posterior and kernel functions;
- Linear regression and simple binary choice models with diffuse/conjugate priors;
- Bayesian point estimates, testing, and forecasting;
- Monte Carlo integration [importance sampling, MCMC methods (e.g. Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings)];
